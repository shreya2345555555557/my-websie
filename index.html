                    <p>A laboratory is always considered as a relevant and essential part so far as the teaching of Science and Computer is concerned.”

                        This helps students to remember the studies in a better way by conducting their own experiments. It gives students first-hand experience and offers better opportunities for learning. A laboratory is not a contest whose object is to get the “right answer”, but the purpose is to learn how to gain knowledge, how to observe and to learn the meaning of what happens.</p>
